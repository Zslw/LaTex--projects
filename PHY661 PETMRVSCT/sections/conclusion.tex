This paper compares the advantages and limitations of PET/CT and PET/MR in liver cancer radiotherapy, it has a focus on their impact on tumor delineation, dosimetry, and treatment planning. PET/CT remains the gold standard for many clinical applications and PET/MR demonstrates significant potential in improving targeting accuracy and providing superior soft-tissue contrast. Future research and the development of standardized protocols will set the way in overcoming current limitations and ensuring these technologies achieve their full clinical potential in precision radiotherapy.
