%Whatâ€™s the problem?

%\vspace{-1em}
%There is a concern on whether a patient with retained post-surgical epicardial leads can safely be scanned in an MRI device because the interaction of the magnetic field, RF and gradients with these leads are still not well defined. They may rise problems such as RF-induced heating, translational forces, and torques and induced currents. In previous graduate student thesis and research, these risks and issues were highlighted.  \cite{haddix2022, aboyewa2021}. The thesis pointed out that over 50\% of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) will require MRI in their lifetime \cite{aboyewa2021}. Moreover, there is a lack of consensus across clinical guidelines that leaves physicians with the task to assess risks on a case-by-case basis.

%\boldtext{Objective:} To synthesize findings on MRI safety with epicardial leads, focusing on RF heating, magnetic forces, and torques, while identifying research gaps and proposing strategies for safer imaging.

%How was it studied?
To answer whether safety concerns signify the outlined risk tissue-equivalent phantoms were designed, created and tested in previous research. Figure \ref{fig:phantom_design} shows the the phantom design and experimental setup used and table \ref{tab:phantom_characterization} compares the properties of the phantom materials to ASTM standards, confirming their clinical relevance.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phantom Design:} Tissue-equivalent phantoms developed by Aboyewa in 2021 simulate clinical conditions, measuring RF heating under SAR values of $\sim$2 W/kg and providing a well defined methodology for simulating patient conditions and measuring RF-induced heating \cite{aboyewa2021}.
    \item \textbf{Preliminary Results:} Findings indicate leads shorter than 13 cm exhibit minimal heating under 3T MRI conditions. Orientation significantly impacts RF heating \cite{aboyewa2021}.
    %\item \textbf{Force Measurement:} Translational forces and torques were calculated using theoretical models and validated experimentally \cite{haddix2022}.
    \item \textbf{Heating Studies:} Temperature rise increases with lead length as showed on figure \ref{fig:lead_temp_rise}, this finding establishes the expected threshold for classification of leads on MRI Safety.
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:lead_temp_rise}
\end{figure}

\begin{quote}
Aboyewa further explored the effects of implant configuration on RF-induced heating. Figure \ref{fig:implant_orientation} illustrates the influence of implant orientation, shape, and length on maximum temperature rise.

\boldtext{Implant Configuration and RF-Induced Heating:} 
The straight configuration showed the highest temperature rise due to the antenna effect. Rotating the lead by 45$^\circ$ toward the right-side wall (TRS) or center (TC), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:implant_orientation}(b), reduced heating by more than half. An 8-fold reduction in heating was observed when the lead was bent into an arc, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:implant_orientation}(c). Although temperature rise increases with lead length \cite{aboyewa2021}, lead orientation and shape must also be considered to predict behavior in the MRI environment.

\posterSection{Recent Advancements}
%What was learned?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Force and Torque Studies:} The Haddix proposal outlines experiments to measure translational forces and torques, with findings suggesting that forces are typically less than 10\% of the lead's weight at the bore entrance \cite{haddix2022}.
    \item \textbf{Research Gaps:} Limited studies exist on the effects of RF-induced electrical stimulation in leads, requiring further exploration.
    \item \textbf{Safety Evidence:} Several recent studies have demonstrated the safety of MRI in patients with abandoned or epicardial leads when following specific protocols. Table \ref{tab:recent_findings} summarizes key findings from these studies.

%What can we do?
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Technological Advances:} Improvements in MRI-conditional devices and scanning protocols have minimized risks like RF heating and device malfunction.
    \item Limiting lead lengths to reduce RF heating risks \cite{aboyewa2021} and developing MRI-specific lead configurations to minimize mechanical interactions \cite{haddix2022}.
    \item \textbf{Clinical Impact:} Updated guidelines now cautiously include patients with abandoned and epicardial leads, reducing delays in critical diagnostics.
    \item \textbf{MRI Workflow Recommendations:} In the College of cardiology an article outlines steps for preparation, monitoring, and post-scan follow-up, ensuring patient safety and device functionality for managing MRI safety protocols in patients with CIEDs depicted in Figure \ref{fig:safety_protocols}.
